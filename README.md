# About Me

I'm Japanese and scientist with Ph.D. in Physics and [Google Developer Expert (GDE) in G Suite](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-kanshi_tanaike). My curiosity is to quest, think and create. Especially, I always like to create new things which are not exist in this world yet. Basically I find such new things during sleep.
